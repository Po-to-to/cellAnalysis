# cellAnalysis
A test repo for the course "Entry level computer-programming and data analysis for biomedical students II" at Semmelweis University, Hungary.

We will jointly work on a Python code that will segment and analyze microscopic images of cells. 

Roughly, the steps will include:

1. loading the images
2. recognition of cells and their organelles by artificial intelligence
3. localization of the protein of interest within the cells

The scripts will be turned into a web application at the end of this semester (2021/2022 spring).

Stay tuned! 42
