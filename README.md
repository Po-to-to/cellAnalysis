# cellAnalysis

cellAnalysis is created by the participants of a programming course. 
We aim to create a software capable of analysing microscopic images. The exact functions of this software are yet to be defined.
Besides the main objective of the project it is also important for us to learn the basics of developing and collaborative work as a team. This also helps us refining our coding skills. 
In this regard cellAnalysis can be considered a test project.
Still, we hope to create a useful tool for colleagues, ourselves and anyone who might be interested.
