# cellAnalysis
A test repo for the course "Entry level computer-programming for biomedical students II".

We will jointly work on a Python code that will analyze microscopic images of cells. 

Roughly, the steps will include:

1. loading the images
2. recognition of cells and their organelles by artificial intelligence
3. localization of the protein of interest within the cells

The scripts will be turned into a web application as a final step.
